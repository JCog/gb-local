# gb-local
This is a collection of functions designed to pair with [Goombotio](https://github.com/JCog/goombotio) and run on the local machine. As of right now it only tracks sub points and outputs them to a file for OBS, but it doesn't even do that well because Twitch's sub API doesn't return accurate results when someone upgrades their sub tier, so the result will usually be too low.
